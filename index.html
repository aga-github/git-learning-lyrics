        <p>     All these accidents that happen, follow the dot, 
                Coincidence makes sense, only with you, 
                You don't have to speak, I feel. 
                
                Emotional landscapes, 
                They puzzle me, 
                The riddle gets solved, 
                And you push me up to...
                
                This state of emergency, how beautiful to be, 
                State of emergency, is where I want to be. 
                
                All that no-one sees you see, what's inside of me, 
                Every nerve that hurts you heal, deep inside of me oohoohh
                You don't have to speak, I feel. 
                Emotional landscapes, 
                They puzzle me, confuse, 
                Can, the riddle get solved? 
                And you push me up to...
                
                This state of emergency, how beautiful to be, 
                State of emergency, is where I want to be,
                State of emergency, how beautiful to be, 
                
                Emotional landscapes, 
                They puzzle me, 
                The riddle gets solved, 
                And you push me up to...
                
                This state of emergency, how beautiful to be, 
                State of emergency, is where I want to be,
